#### 📝 Parameter Details:

| Parameter | Description | Recommended |
|:---------:|:------------|:-----------:|
| **Target Address** | The wallet address you want to imitate, or select a rule file | Required |
| **Prefix Length** | Number of characters to match at the beginning (0-10) | 0 or 2 |

### 🎯 Step 3: Two Usage Modes

#### Mode 1: Single Address Matching (Recommended for Beginners)

<p align="center">
  <img width="100%" src="/software3.png?raw=true"/>
</p>

**Steps:**

1. In the "Target Address" input box, enter a TRON address (34 characters starting with T)
   ```
   Example: TG2CMGxnTPgQ6V58kiKd7wbyN8ewtAmY76
   ```

2. Set matching rules:
   - **Prefix Length**: Enter `2` (means the first 2 characters of the new address must match the target)
   - **Suffix Length**: Enter `6` (means the last 6 characters of the new address must match the target)

3. Click **"Start Generation"** button

4. Wait for completion, results will be displayed in the "Generation Results" area

---

#### Mode 2: Batch Rule File (Advanced Users)

**Steps:**

1. Create a text file (e.g., `rule.txt`), write one target address or rule per line:
   ```
   TTTTTTTTTTZZZZZZZZZZ
   TTTTTTTTTT8888888888
   TG2CMGxnTPgQ6V58kiKd7wbyN8ewtAmY76
   ```

2. Click "Select File" button and choose your `rule.txt`

3. Set matching rules:
   - **Prefix Length**: Enter `0`
   - **Suffix Length**: Enter `6` or `8`

**Example:**
```
Target Address: TTTTTTTTTT8888888888

Prefix 0 + Suffix 6, generated result:
TGxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx666666
↑↑                              ↑↑↑↑↑↑
Prefix 0 match                   Suffix 6 match
```

4. Click **"Start Generation"** button

---

### 📊 Step 4: View Results

Generation results will be displayed in real-time in the "Generation Results" area at the bottom:

<p align="center">
  <img width="100%" src="/software2.png?raw=true"/>
</p>

**Results Include:**
- **Address**: Newly generated vanity address
- **Private Key**: Corresponding private key (keep it safe!)

---

### 💾 Step 5: Export Results

Click **"Export Results"** button, select save location, and all generated addresses and private keys will be exported as a text file.

> ⚠️ **Security Tip**: Private keys are extremely important, please keep them safe and never share with anyone!

## 💡 Beginner's Guide

### ⭐ First-Time Usage Recommendations

**Strongly recommended** settings for first-time use:

| Parameter | Recommended | Reason |
|:---------:|:-----------:|:-------|
| Prefix Length | `0` | Lower difficulty, faster results |
| Suffix Length | `6` | 6-digit suffix can produce results in minutes |
| Generate Count | `1` | Stop after generating 1 address |

**Why?**
- Higher suffix length = longer computation time
- 6-digit suffix ≈ minutes
- 7-digit suffix ≈ tens of minutes
- 8-digit suffix ≈ hours
- 10-digit suffix ≈ days

**Recommended Process:**
1. First test with suffix 6 to confirm the program outputs normally
2. After confirming it works, increase the digits as needed

### 🎨 Vanity Address Recommendations

To generate a "lookalike address" that resembles a target address:

| Goal | Prefix | Suffix | Difficulty |
|:----:|:------:|:------:|:----------:|
| Simple Lookalike | 2 | 4 | ⭐ Easy |
| Medium Lookalike | 2 | 6 | ⭐⭐ Medium |
| Advanced Lookalike | 2 | 8 | ⭐⭐⭐ Hard |

**Example:**
```
Target Address: TG2CMGxnTPgQ6V58kiKd7wbyN8ewtAmY76

Prefix 2 + Suffix 6, generated result:
TGxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxtAmY76
↑↑                              ↑↑↑↑↑↑
Prefix 2 match                    Suffix 6 match
```
